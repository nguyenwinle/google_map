#Neighborhood Map

This project is a a interactive map of some places to go to for fun in the night time in Sacramento. I wanted to match the google maps color theme which is in black and gray so I thought why not choose some locations in the night life since I wanted to incorporate a style to the map without having to use the default. 

The functionality of this application includes: map markers to identify some clubs in Sacramento, a search function in the side navigation to discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Using a third-party API such as foursquare, I am able to retrieve data such as website, phone number, twitter, and facebook and display them inside the infowindow.
